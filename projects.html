                1. Concept
            </h2>
        
            <p><br><br>CoffeeGround is based in finding environmental sustainability tools within the mundane. The brand has stationed out "GroundStations" in several locations in the city,
                that are very similar to Sweden's pantsystem.<br><br>Using your CoffeeGround app, your proceed to scan the GroundStations unique QR-code and sign in to verify your identity.<br>
                After that you load in your coffeegrounds in provided bags into the Station, and after analyzing the quality, the machine confirms the exchange. The GroundStations get the coffeegrounds,
                and you get some money.<br><br>
                The coffeegrounds work as fertilizer for plant growth, and will be used in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden, to create a greener and sustainable future.

            </h2>
        
            <p><br><br>To research the subject I sent out a form to people, where they got to tell me about their habits when it comes to "panting" as well as recycling in general.
                In the result, the great majority's (75%) answers told me they frequently went to pant, where 60% did it for the money they gained back by doing so, meanwhile
                the rest were doing it for the sake of the environment.<br><br>I had a hypothesis that the greatest motivational factor to pant was because of the money you earn back by doing it,
                and the results from the form confirmed it. This led me to keep going with my concept.

                3. Stylesheet
            </h2>
        
            <p><br><br>As for the colors I knew I wanted colors associated with nature and the environment, as well as create a peaceful atmoshphere. Therefore I went for green and blue.
                Green is often associated with greenery in nature and I believed the blue to act as a sky, since the shade is very light. I also liked the use of blue because of it's
                associations with trustworthiness and loyalty. Someone taking care of your personal information has to appear as those things, or the customer may look to someone else.<br><br>
                The shapes I have used are very round and soft, both because it is a personal preference, but also to bring out the customer's softer sides as well, which makes them more
                likely to use the service.<br><br>
                I have used two fonts, Zasline as a serif display font and Inter as the body text and for less important elements in the design to not attract as much attention.

            </h2>
        
            <p><br><br>The wireframes I put a lot of effort into, as they are essentially black and white versions of the final prototype. I built these and iterated continuously based on feedback
                I got frequently when I was working in Figma by peers. I created a design I found made sense to me instinctically, and then confirmed whether my idea was likable to the customers.
                <br><br>When I was happy with the design, I started making things into components. I used the system "atomic design"
                as it is favored in the field, and I wish to learn and get better at it. This made it very easy for me in the upcoming prototype stage.

                5. Figma Prototype
            </h2>
        
            <p> In the prototype stage it was all about making it look alive and real. So I added the colors and tried out different combinations, but I ended up with a very light color scheme with dark accents.
                Since I used images as well in the project I lowered their opacity to make them less overwhelming considering the rest of the app has a lot of color.<br><br>
                I tested the app and got AAA WCAG as well as reasonable results for color blindness variants. Since no button color meant anything specific, this was not an issue.
